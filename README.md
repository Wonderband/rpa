This is the test assignment developed on Python using Selenium by Alex Koniushenko
The main goal is to automate the form filling on the web page: https://rpachallenge.com/
Main file to run is rpa_challenge_automation.py

STEPS:

   venv\Scripts\activate

   In Git Bash or Unix-like shells, you should use this command:
   source venv/Scripts/activate

   On macOS and Linux:  
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
